TETRIS

A modern, responsive Tetris clone built with HTML5 Canvas and pure JavaScript.
Description
Experience the timeless arcade classic reimagined with a vibrant, retro-neon aesthetic. Neon Tetris is a fully-responsive web-based game built from the ground up using pure JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API.

It features the complete, classic Tetris experience, including dynamic scoring, a leveling system that increases game speed, and a "next piece" preview. The project is styled with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, modern UI and includes intuitive on-screen controls for a seamless mobile experience alongside traditional desktop keyboard support.

Technologies Used

HTML5: Semantic structure for the game layout, modals, and info panels.

CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS): Utility-first framework for rapid, responsive UI development. Custom CSS is used for the 'Press Start 2P' font and the signature neon-glow effects.

JavaScript (ES6+):

Handles all core game logic, including piece movement, rotation (matrix transposition), collision detection, and line clearing.

Manages the game state (score, level, pause, game over).

Uses requestAnimationFrame for an efficient game loop.

Manipulates the DOM for UI updates (score, level) and modal interactions.

HTML5 Canvas API: Used to draw the game board, the falling pieces, and the "next piece" preview.
